either way even wanted to say was good for you to receive your for you online but also be here on Wednesday for you to turn in as well call Paul from Friday I went over an example problem everyday bar that was rotating I know it's rotating by sliding down a wall and we came up with five equations and equation for a y n a taxi going to be all your Dynamic stuff for your for some of the forces Max directions to the force in the y direction and I need some of those moments most likely going to be in a z Direction okay cuz word using about cleaner in a dog trainer Dynamic Solutions going to be the same direction basically and and then you find your kinematic relationships natural resources in the long sleeve examples on that and then I would like you to work through that on your own for these are going to be the success of homework problems but I'm going to show you how to set them up first can you get more practice if you need it list of first dates to check it out the problem that were working with so we have a slider here and the slider is holding a block and it's being hot how's it going in to the right acceleration there's no rotation here not rotating at all I need to ask you for the tension in the cable so the first thing you want to do and she want to draw free body diagram with all the loads on it can really do that they want to find the acceleration can the cables we draw all this set a reminder Dimensions to get we also have this label St they give us the tango the same and then also we have to wait Lamarcus Shannon www4 angular velocity and we only have one acceleration linear acceleration because it's 6 and the other direction so we have this a but we can just simply say this is a i g and the extra action because all the other components are Asura commands superdrol dr. to tension one sauces are so when I'm going to call it and then this one here is our two so you can determine what are long enough to say me before for the for the linear stuff forces in action these are all equal to the mass times the acceleration of G and extraction forces acceleration 0 name some of the movies and we said that on the counter clockwise directions positive so just always do that only have the sanitation, you don't mess things up about center of gravity were going to call this for Center Mass sorry I'm on call this point G Nicole's Alpha Francis we don't have any rotation rotation 0 you know how to do the summation of the forces act like she's supposed to know why I'm still in the Still Moments now you can bring this up and two components testing get your ex component and you know do that for you to cross products to our crosses the tier-1 collector so you know this direction and then yes also add the other one proximity to so that's probably 2.5 song are you know find all your relationships you find inspectors you cross them and when you get your forces you'll come out to the correct answer here alarm for 10 Rihanna rotation hours moving in a linear Direction I want to do is 18 and 1/5 385 and this one is a pulley with a mass attached to it Nancy 2.5 forgiven and on the pulley we have a mass attached by rope all the roast mass is not taking into account but we need the master pulley is going to take a new account to a previously we never took Napoleon Total cuz all we did was dealing with angular momentum as well so they give us the moment of inertia and then we have a one kilogram mass and that's released that's so how far to the Fallen Define text to our how far it goes but we have to find out what the book values are so basically we need the acceleration of velocity we need to draw and they even give you the hint to draw these free body diagram separately which is what we've been doing all before so we have been drawn and circuit diagrams so the original one where we had this pulling in the center there and we have some Mass attached to it and says up when I call this be and this is radius R Tennessee for weekend Define all we have is this tension clean up the weight of a $1 time to gravity as long as I grab these no point in this direction cancel that forces are holding the pulley in that spot a y -1 would be RBX a good habit is always just to draw the reaction forces in the positive direction that way when you draw all your equations are some of horses in the X-Men estimation courses in awhile you don't have to be worried about negative and positive he's always be positive values and then that just means they're pointing you know in the negative Direction have to do that and then also we have our attention it's right here I also have a weight on here to Sequoia has a way of putting down you have some acceleration we know that there celery is going in this direction but I'm for purposes of keeping this on thanks for keeping us call u+ an original equation in a positive direction same as what we've been doing with these reaction forces so we're assuming that this Alpha is Direction going in the opposite direction remember wise is positive or negative that way we don't mess up this equation here this some of the moments is equal to I also deposit Forex so now when you go to do for some of the forces and moments m4a unfortunately Direction This equals mass times acceleration in the y direction and this is of block a cancer a few I'll draw your celebration here to acceleration Ally okay and there is no moments acting on this part so you don't have to do that unproportioned you realize that all the time the forces are really do anything for this equation that kind of cancel out all your leftover with answer some of the moments about this point here or I call this point I'll be here cause I said that this is going the only moment acting at point B since all these forces are acting directly on point be the only one that's acting as a mower honesty is going in a clockwise Direction which means it's negative lined up with this negative TR cars with the radius of the sphere is equal to this one this one should be like calculator there are some kinematic relationships you might have to find out as well any problems when you have connected blocks on pulleys the tensions are no longer the same anymore because we actually have a mass in between from before when we were assuming masses police also basically what happened was happening this summer before we had these two masses connected to a boy and one of them is I you know falling down and dragging the other one along the ground however in this case we have to take them out join the Confederation building tensions in the line are not the same you dropped the same y'all the same here or even other tension attached to it so the original picture looks where you have your Black Label that's okay and then we have this line and a point of going to be on block me before we wrote that this is not the case so this would be 81 in this more be T1 is not equal to T2 we have a pulley with mass of course the teas are equal not a method school anymore however your celebrations will be the same what does Napoleon Center lines may not be the same for the acceleration of blocks will be the same stuff you have the baby here and this one here eggs equals a. setting up this problem too many unknowns when you're done we do the same thing as before 4 we have this before so this is nothing new are normal we have our way to Big W acceleration has some tension attention 1 can we have some friction so friction the same thing can be done about 10 and then we have our way acceleration acceleration the pulley for the dryer pulley like this and we have our reaction show me how are we have our CIA back so we have our weak so weak of C directions to positive direction we also have our attention we are T2 and we have so Tijuana up here so now can you go through and do your some of the forces and moments in each one of these two won't have any moment because they're just blocked or not Sonic forces extraction it says ma Sona forces Hawaii directions Singapore Sazon y direction equals m a nursery Massapequa celebration is the maxillary that part before we have some radius or hear the pulley ism Delta that's going out us to be you know T2 going my clockwise Direction X or I'll let you guys do this and then see one would be going can someone should be positive and negative for the moment and any leftover this out but I don't notice that you need some relationship Queen Elsa Play-Doh that people like this however we don't know the relationship between this house of here you're going to have to figure out any figured out you think so also is related to its related two substances circular motion we can say that are a is equal to 4 are also make sure you get the sign right though when you're doing so the first acceleration is going this way you should realize that it's the negative of this where you doing this our relationship here I'm talking about for circular motion one more wanted to do the new finding eyes are you considered to be a 1849 servantes 290 because we have a positive connotation of two different kinds of objects thunder rod and then we have a circular disc so we need to determine what the eye is of each one separately because they're both rotating about this point I'll holler this is a pin connection it's not actually fixed so the disc is not completely fixed to the rod install rotate about this pain in this picture problem but they do is they put here so basically someone holding it or something and then it's just anime apps to tell what's the acceleration at that particular instance of this point pay here this one turn on this one
